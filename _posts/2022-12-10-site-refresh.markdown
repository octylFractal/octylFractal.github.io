I've gone through and given the site a slightly different theme, to better fit how I want to represent myself. I've also
used [WAVE] to improve the accessibility of the site, so it should be top-notch. Let me know if you find any improvements
I could make in this area. I really enjoy how WAVE works and recommend it for any accessibility work you do.

As usual, I've also updated some dependencies to the latest version as of writing: Bootstrap (5.2.3), Jekyll (4.3.1),
and Jekyll Feed (0.16.0).
