I've removed the monospace formatting of some parts of the site to make it easier to read, notably the navbar and post
text. I noticed while writing the next blog post that the monospace font was making the text difficult to read,
but I still prefer to have the other pages in monospace as I think it looks nice. I also changed the font from Lato
to Libre Baskerville which looks better at 16px.

There was also a ton of adjustments to improve mobile behavior.
