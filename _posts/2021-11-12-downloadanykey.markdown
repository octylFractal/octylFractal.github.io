I've written a new site, a riff on <https://downloadmoreram.com/>, entitled ["Download Any
Key!"](https://downloadanykey.com/). This new site was a fun way for me to learn some new skills, like deploying a
[DNSLink](http://dnslink.io/)-based site and Blender. As hinted, this site _is_ IPFS-enabled, so it should theoretically
last until the failure of the IPFS network, though currently with a small reliance on the DNS system as well. I hope to
add more content to this in the future, and am open to PRs if you have some creative ideas!

The site's source is available at <https://github.com/octylFractal/downloadanykey.com>.
