On a whim, I felt like adding additional texture to the left and right sides of the site where no main content is
present. I originally was going to integrate something from [&lt;css-doodle/&gt;](https://css-doodle.com/) but I
could not figure out how to make the patterns I wanted statically, as I don't want to require JavaScript to view the
site as intended (~~I'm aware that on small screens, it is required to use the navbar. If you have suggestions for this,
please let me know!~~ Edit Aug 08 2024: I've done a hacky fix for this). So instead, I searched around and found this
["Background Image Generator"](https://bg.siteorigin.com/) and selected a pattern that I thought looked nice.

In order to ensure it meshes with the existing page, the new patterns have shadows around the edges. I also added a
shadow around the navbar and footer to make them stand above the content. I'm quite happy with the results, and I hope
you enjoy them as well!
