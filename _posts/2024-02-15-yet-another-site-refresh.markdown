The content on this site has again been updated to reflect an approximation of my current self.
Mostly this is an update to Bootstrap (5.3.2) and a move away from any third-party sites, to entirely self-hosted
content. I've disliked relying on them due to the potential for them to disappear, and the fact that they can
affect my uptime (though this site is still primarily hosted on GitHub Pages, so it's not entirely self-hosted).
